        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Another example of the disgusting proclivities of the average US
            American, the hot dog is an extruded mass of flesh, which has been
            ground from dozens of different corpses and piped into a casing of
            intenstine. Truly, only a people with no soul could invent such a
            food.
