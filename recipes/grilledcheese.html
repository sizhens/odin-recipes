        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A remarkably simple dish, the grilled cheese has been a staple of
            the American household for millennia. Frequently affectionately
            referred to as the "girled cheese" by the ubiquitous Online
            Trangender Lesbian, the Grilled Cheese has become a figure of near
            godlike power in the broken minds of the average US American Setter.
            Made with easily-melting slabs of American Cheese, and grilled with
            Butter, the Grilled Cheese is a monument to the average American's
            hubris and depravity.
